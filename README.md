Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wanted to modernize operations and implement new software.They needed security done for their web app and vulernabilities to be found.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a good job locating vulnerabilities and using the cve codes to identifty solutions. It is important to practice good secure coding so that risks can be minimized. Software security adds tremendous value to a company's health.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

It was helpful to think about vulnerabilities from the many angles where they can occur, whether it be from how code is written, or which plugins are used and how up to date are they.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

By adding input validation, updating plugins, and reviewing code we can mitigate many risks.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Comparing vulneravility assessments and checking if anything changed can be a great way to check if new vulnerabilities were introduced when refactoring code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The cve site and the nvsd site are great resources to use.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

This assignment was great for working on building good secure coding habits and a strong foundation to build upon. The next project in the course then applied all of this with hands on practical work.
